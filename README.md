#Introduction
This project is a AZPR SoC implementation for SEA Board.

The AZPR SoC is a well-organized and easy-to-understand processor system-on-a-chip for education purpose. The AZPR SoC is developed for the Japaness textbook 《CPU自作入T》 （Witten by 水^ 一, 米 | and 藤田 裕士）,  which is then translated to Chinese, namely 《CPU自制入门》(Translated by Qian Zhao)。
